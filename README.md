# YouTube 360 video embed

At this moment embedded YouTube 360° videos is not working properly in all browsers.

This repo contains a simple script and demo page using the [YouTube Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) and a simple `browserSupports360()` function [1] for forcing to go to YouTube site on non-working browsers and mobile devices. On mobile devices the browser will open the YouTube app (if installed) and plays the 360° video.

**Original note from YouTube**
```
To watch 360° videos, you need the latest version of Chrome, Opera, Firefox, 
or MS Edge on your computer. On mobile devices, use the latest version of the 
YouTube app.
